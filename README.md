### Hiring Managers & Recruiters

If you're looking for a developer who:

- Brings modern patterns (hooks, context, atomic components, testing)
- Can ship fast, learn faster, and improve DX/UX collaboratively
- Delivers clean GitHub repos, live demos, and testable UIs

I’d love to connect. I’m actively exploring front-end opportunities with teams that value code quality, curiosity, and ownership.
